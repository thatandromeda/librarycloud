  <h2>Project and rationale</h2>

  <p>
    I (Andromeda) was delighted to see, when I got to the Harvard LibraryCloud hackathon
    (1 December 2014), that there were some half-dozen other women in the room. Yay!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the organizer asked who was there for the tutorial and almost every other
    woman in the room raised her hand. Sigh.
  </p>

  <p>
    My intersectional feminism looks like code, so here's an app to explore popular items
    in the Harvard library collection. It takes a search term (presently hardcoded to "women"),
    looks for it in the subject field, and sorts by stackscore (a popularity index running from
    0 to 100).  It also investigates whether other axes of diversity are represented in these
    items the Harvard community consider when building their mental models.
  </p>

  <p>
    What's there? What's missing?
  </p>

  <h2>Key</h2>

  <p>
    The code searches the LibraryCloud API for a topic with your querystring
    (or a querystring randomly chosen from a list when you first load the page).
    It displays the most popular items in the Harvard collection matching that search,
    and highlights the ones whose subject headers also include common headers for women's
    studies, African-American studies, or LGBT content.
  </p>
